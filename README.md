### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my github profile.

_Hello! Sorry I'm not home, but I've gone to rescue my friends, who were captured by ~Bowser~ bad development practices._

## Principles
- **SOLID**: Design software components that are easy to extend, test, and maintain through clear responsibilities and well-defined abstractions.
- **Testability first**: Architect systems that are easy to validate through automated unit, integration, and contract testing.
- **Observability as a feature**: Treat logging, metrics, and tracing as first-class concerns to ensure operability and fast incident resolution.
- **Scalability by design**: Build systems that scale horizontally through stateless services, distributed asynchronous communication, and elastic infrastructure.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decouple business logic, infrastructure, and presentation layers.
- **DRY**: "Don't Repeat Yourself", enforce reusing already tested and certified code.
- **KISS**: "Keep It Simple, ~Sir~", Prefer the simplest solution that solves the problem, avoiding over-engineering and unnecessary abstractions.
- **Fail Fast & Resilience**: Detect failures early and design systems to degrade gracefully using retries, timeouts, circuit breakers, and idempotency.
